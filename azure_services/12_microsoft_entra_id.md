- **Conditional Access**: Enables policies to control access based on conditions like user location, device state, and risk level.
- **Identity Protection**: Detects and responds to identity risks using machine learning.
- **Application Management**: Integrates with thousands of SaaS applications and supports custom app development.
- **Device Management**: Manages and secures devices accessing corporate resources.

## Components
