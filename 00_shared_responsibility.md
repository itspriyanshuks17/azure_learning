# 🤝 Azure Shared Responsibility Model

## 📌 Overview
The **Shared Responsibility Model** is a fundamental cloud security concept. In an on-premises datacenter, you own the whole stack (from physical security to applications). In the cloud, Microsoft Azure takes over some physical and operational burdens, but **you** remain responsible for other aspects.

> **Key Concept**: Security **OF** the Cloud (Azure's job) vs. Security **IN** the Cloud (Your job).

## 🏗️ Responsibility Matrix

The division of responsibility depends on the cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS).

| Responsibility | On-Premises | IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) | PaaS (Platform as a Service) | SaaS (Software as a Service) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Information & Data** | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You |
| **Devices (Mobile/PC)** | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You |
| **Accounts & Identities** | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You | 👤 You |
| **Identity & Directory Infra** | 👤 You | 👤 You | 🤝 Shared | ☁️ Microsoft |
| **Applications** | 👤 You | 👤 You | 🤝 Shared / ☁️ Msft | ☁️ Microsoft |

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown

### 1. ☁️ Microsoft's Responsibility (Security OF the Cloud)
Microsoft covers the global infrastructure and foundational services.
- **Physical Security**: Guards, fences, cameras at Azure datacenters.
- **Host Infrastructure**: Compute servers, storage arrays, networking hardware.
- **Virtualization Layer**: The hypervisor (Hyper-V context) ensuring tenant isolation.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to standards (ISO, SOC, HIPAA, FedRAMP).

### 2. 👤 Your Responsibility (Security IN the Cloud)
You are always responsible for:
- **Data**: Data classification, encryption (at rest and in transit).
- **Endpoints**: Securing devices that connect to Azure.
- **Accounts**: Identity management (MFA, RBAC, PIM) using **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD).
- **Access Management**: Who can do what in your Azure subscription.

### 3. 🤝 Shared Responsibility
Some layers vary based on the service type:
- **Patching**:
    - **IaaS (e.g., Azure VM)**: You patch the OS.
    - **PaaS (e.g., Azure SQL)**: Microsoft patches the OS/DB engine; you manage firewall rules.
- **Networking**:
    - **IaaS**: You configure VNETs, NSGs, and Route Tables.
    - **PaaS**: Microsoft provides the connectivity; you configure Service Endpoints/Private Links.

## 💡 Exam Tips for AZ-900
- **SaaS**: Microsoft handles the most (e.g., Office 365). You only really manage Data & Identity.
- **IaaS**: You handle the most (e.g., Azure VMs). You are responsible for the O.S. (patching, anti-virus).
- **On-Premises**: You handle everything.
- **ALWAYS Your Responsibility**: Data, Endpoints, Accounts, Access Management.
