(fast, private). 2. wan (international flight) - hinglish: ek desh se dusre desh jana. (long distance, public infrastructure use karna padta hai). 3. vlan (office cubicles) - hinglish: ek bada hall (switch) hai, lekin humne beech mein kaanch ki deewarein (vlan) laga di hain taaki hr ki baatein engineering wale na sun sakein using logic, not bricks. 4. vpn (secure pipe) - hinglish: imagine karo crowd mein se ja rahe ho (internet), lekin tumne ek \"invisible pipe\" (tunnel) bana li hai. koi bahar wala tumhe dekh nahi sakta, aur tum safe ho. --- ⚡ exam tips for az-900 1. vnet = vlan: conceptually, when you create an azure vnet, you are creating your own isolated vlan in the azure cloud. 2. expressroute = wan: expressroute is a dedicated wan link replacing the public internet."},{"title":"Cloud Benefits","url":"00_cloud_benefits.html","content":"🌟 benefits of cloud computing 📌 overview understanding the core benefits of the cloud is essential for the az-900 exam. these characteristics explain why businesses move from on-premises datacenters to azure. --- 1. high availability (ha) ⏱️ definition: the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible for a long period of time, even if some components fail. - concept: \"up time\" (e.g., 99.99% sla). - azure implementation: - availability zones: run vms in different physical buildings to survive a fire/flood. - region pairs: replicate data to a different geography to survive a major regional outage. - example: if one server crashes, the load balancer instantly directs traffic to a healthy server. 2. scalability 📈 definition: the ability to increase or decrease resources to meet changing demand. - vertical scaling (scale up): adding more power (cpu/ram) to an existing vm. - horizontal scaling (scale out): adding more vms to a cluster. - benefit: you don't need to over-provision hardware \"just in case\" you get a traffic spike. 3. elasticity 🪀 definition: the ability to automatically scale resources out and in based on demand. - difference from scalability: scalability is the capability; elasticity is the automatic action. - example: web app automatically adds 5 instances during black friday sale and removes them afterwards. - benefit: cost optimization (pay only for what you use). 4. agility 🏃‍♂️ definition: the ability to deploy resources and applications quickly. - on-prem: ordering a physical server takes weeks. - cloud: spinning up a vm takes minutes. - benefit: faster time-to-market for new features and products. 5. geo-distribution 🌍 definition: the ability to deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe. - benefit: - lower latency: serve data from a location close to the user (e.g., using azure front door or cdns). - data sovereignty: keep data in a specific country to comply with laws (gdpr). 6. disaster recovery (dr) 🚑 definition: the ability to recover from rare but major failures (natural disasters, cyber attacks). - azure implementation: - azure site recovery: replicates vms to another region. - azure backup: keeps safe copies of data. - benefit: minimal downtime and data loss (rpo/rto) compared to managing your own secondary datacenter. --- --- 💡 hinglish explanation (cloud benefits) 1. high availability (hamesha available) - concept: aapka app kabhi down nahi hona chahiye. - hinglish: agar ek server fail ho jaye, toh doosra turant take over kar lega. socho jaise agar aapki car kharab ho gayi, toh backup car ready hai, isliye aapka safar nahi ruka. 2. scalability (bada ya chota karna) - concept: traffic ke hisaab se resources badhana. - hinglish: - vertical (scale up): laptop ki ram 8gb se 16gb karna (powerful banana). - horizontal (scale out): ek laptop ke bajaye 2 laptop use karna. 3. elasticity (rubber band ki tarah) - concept: automatic scaling. - hinglish: jab sale lagti hai (e.g., big billion days) toh automatic naye servers add ho jate hain. sale khatam hote hi servers delete ho jate hain. aapko kuch karne ki zaroorat nahi, system khud manage karta hai. 4. geo-distribution (duniya bhar mein) - concept: data user ke paas rakhna. - hinglish: agar user india mein hai, toh data india ke datacenter se aayega. agar user us mein hai, toh us se. isse speed (latency) fast hoti hai. 5. disaster recovery (musibat ka plan) - concept: data safe rakhna. - hinglish: agar mumbai datacenter mein aag lag gayi, toh bhi aapka data chennai datacenter mein safe rahega aur aapka business chalta rahega. --- 💡 exam cheat sheet (az-900 definitions) | term | definition checklist | | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | | high availability | \"continuous operation\", \"sla\", \"99.99%\", \"clusters\". | | scalability | \"handle growth\", \"add resources\", \"scale up vs scale out\". | | elasticity | \"automatic scaling\", \"spikes in traffic\", \"pay for what you use\". | | agility | \"speed of deployment\", \"minutes not weeks\". | | geo-distribution | \"global reach\", \"low latency for users\", \"data residency\". | | disaster recovery | \"business continuity\", \"failover to another region\", \"backups\". | --- 💰 opex vs capex review - capex (capital expenditure): - spending money upfront on physical infrastructure (on-prem). - you own the asset, but you are responsible for maintenance, power, and cooling. scaling requires buying more hardware. - upfront investment in physical hardware (e.g., buying an f5 appliance). - opex (operational expenditure): - spending money on services or products now and being billed for them. this is the cloud consumption model (pay-as-you-go). - pay-as-you-go model used by azure. you pay only for the traffic processed and the hours the service is active. no upfront costs, and scaling is handled by the cloud provider. | feature | capex (on-prem hardware) | opex (azure load balancers) | | :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- | | upfront cost | high (buying servers/racks) | zero | | scaling | slow (procurement + install) | instant (elasticity) | | maintenance | manual (firmware/hardware) | managed by microsoft | | billing | fixed asset | consumption-based | --- 📊 cost analysis capex (capital expenditure) - upfront cost: high (buying servers/racks). - scaling: slow (procurement + install). - maintenance: manual (firmware/hardware). - billing: fixed asset. opex (operating expenditure) - upfront cost: zero. - scaling: instant (elasticity). - maintenance: managed by microsoft. - billing: consumption-based."},{"title":"Containers","url":"00_containers.html","content":"📦 containerization & docker 📌 overview containerization is an os-level virtualization method used to deploy and run applications without launching an entire virtual machine (vm) for each app. - mantra: \"build once, run anywhere.\" - benefit: a container runs the exact same way on your laptop as it does in the azure cloud. --- 1. containers vs virtual machines 💻 virtual machines (hardware virtualization) - mechanism: a hypervisor (e.g., hyper-v) slices physical hardware into virtual hardware. - heavy: each vm has its own full operating system (kernel), drivers, and binaries. - slow: booting up a full os takes minutes. 📦 containers (os virtualization) - mechanism: a container engine (e.g., docker) slices the operating system resources. - lightweight: all containers share the single host os kernel. they only package the application code and its specific dependencies. - fast: starts in seconds (milliseconds often). | feature | virtual machine (vm) | container | | :------------ | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- | | isolation | hardware level (stronger) | os level (process isolation) | | os | owns a full guest os | shares the host os kernel | | size | gigabytes (gb) | megabytes (mb) | | startup | minutes | seconds | !1767943947427 2. docker fundamentals 🐳 docker is the most popular platform for building and running containers. - dockerfile: a text file with instructions on how to build the image (e.g., \"start with node.js, copy files, run `npm install`\"). - image: the read-only template built from the dockerfile. it contains the app code + libs. - container: the runnable instance of an image. you can run 10 containers from 1 image. - registry: a place to store and share images (like github for binaries). - public: docker hub. - private: azure container registry (acr). --- 3. orchestration (kubernetes) ☸️ running one container is easy (`docker run`). but what if you have 500 containers across 20 servers? you need an orchestrator to: - schedule: decide which server should run the container. - heal: restart a container if it crashes. - scale: add more containers if traffic increases. kubernetes (k8s) is the industry-standard open-source orchestrator. --- 4. azure container services | scenario | azure service | | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | | \"i just want to run this one container.\" | azure container instances (aci) (serverless, fastest). | | \"i need full orchestration for my complex app.\" | azure kubernetes service (aks) (managed k8s cluster). | | \"i want microservices without complexity.\" | azure container apps (aca) (serverless k8s). | | \"i need a private place to store images.\" | azure container registry (acr). | --- --- 💡 hinglish explanation (containers) 1. vm vs container - vm: ek apartment building jahan har flat mein apna kitchen, bathroom, sab kuch alag hai (has own os). - container: ek hotel room jahan kitchen aur laundry shared hai (shares os kernel). isliye yeh fast aur sasta hai. 2. docker (the tool) - hinglish: docker woh tool hai jo aapke code ko \"container\" mein pack karta hai. \"build once, run anywhere\" - agar mere laptop pe chala, toh cloud pe bhi chalega. 3. kubernetes (the manager) - hinglish: agar aapke paas 1 container hai toh aap khud sambhal loge. par agar 1000 containers hain? unko start karna, band karna, crash hone pe restart karna—yeh kaam kubernetes (orchestrator) karta hai. yeh container ka manager hai. --- 💡 exam tips for az-900 - aci: fastest way to run a container. no infrastructure to manage. - aks: for production, large-scale orchestration. - differentiate: - hypervisor = vm. - docker = container. - kubernetes = orchestrator."},{"title":"Cors","url":"00_cors.html","content":"🚦 cross-origin resource sharing (cors) 📌 overview cors (cross-origin resource sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers. it allows or blocks web applications running at one origin (domain) from interacting with resources from a different origin. 🚫 the \"same-origin policy\" (the villain?) by default, browsers enforce the same-origin policy. this means a script running on `google.com` cannot simple fetch data from `facebook.com`. this prevents malicious sites from stealing your data. - origin consists of 3 things: 1. protocol (http vs https) 2. domain (example.com) 3. port (80, 443, 3000) if any of these match, it's the same origin. if any differ, it's cross-origin. --- ⚙️ how cors works when your frontend (e.g., react on `localhost:3000`) tries to call your backend api (e.g., node.js on `localhost:5000`), the browser sees different ports and shouts \"cross origin alert!\". the browser then does steps (typically): 1. preflight request (options): the browser sends a polite http `options` request to the backend asking, \"hey, are you okay with `localhost:3000` talking to you?\" 2. server response: the server must reply with specific headers: - `access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:3000` - `access-control-allow-methods: get, post` 3. actual request: if the browser likes the answer, it sends the actual data request. architecture diagram (the handshake) --- ☁️ cors in azure services you often face cors errors when building spas (single page apps) connecting to azure services. here is where you enable it: 1. azure functions: - go to api > cors in the left menu. - add `http://localhost:3000` (or `*` for testing) to the allowed origins list. 2. azure app service: - same procedure. go to api > cors. 3. azure storage (static website): - since your format is static html/js, if it fetches blobs from another container, you must configure cors rules on that blob service. --- 💡 hinglish explanation (building security) 1. same-origin policy (strict watchman) - hinglish: aapki society ka watchman (browser) bohot strict hai. woh kehta hai, \"agar tum 'tower a' ke resident ho, toh tum sirf 'tower a' ki facilities use kar sakte ho. 'tower b' mein jana mana hai.\" 2. cors (special pass) - hinglish: ab agar apko 'tower b' ke gym mein jana hai, toh 'tower b' ke secretary (server) se ek written permission leni padegi (`access-control-allow-origin`). - jab permission dikhaoge, tabhi watchman (browser) jaane dega. nahi toh gate pe hi rok lega (cors error). 3. preflight (pooch-taach) - hinglish: aap seedha andar nahi ghuste. pehle gate pe puchhte ho \"kya main andar aa sakta hoon?\" (options request). agar permission milti hai, tabhi actual kaam ke liye andar jaate ho. --- ⚡ exam tips - client-side security: remember, cors is a protection enforced by the client (browser), not the server. the server just gives permission; the browser decides whether to respect it. - wildcard (\\): setting `access-control-allow-origin: ` allows anyone to call your api. good for public apis, bad for private ones."},{"title":"Deployment Models","url":"00_deployment_models.html","content":"🌍 cloud deployment models 📌 overview cloud deployment models define where your data is stored and how your customers access it. choosing the right model depends on your budget, security, and scalability needs. --- 1. public cloud services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider (microsoft azure). - examples: azure web apps, azure virtual machines, azure sql database. - ownership: hardware/infrastructure owned by microsoft. - cost: opex (operating expense) - pay-as-you-go, no upfront hardware costs. - pros: - high scalability (virtually unlimited). - no maintenance (microsoft manages hardware). - quick deployment. - specific security/compliance requirements might not be met for certain industries. - less control over physical hardware. architecture diagram (public) 2. private cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. a private cloud can be physically located at your on-site organization’s datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. - examples: azure stack hub (running azure services in your own datacenter). - ownership: hardware is owned by you (or a dedicated host). - cost: capex (capital expense) - upfront investment in hardware/software. - pros: - complete control over environment and security. - tailored to specific legacy applications. - high initial cost and ongoing maintenance. - limited scalability compared to public cloud. - you are responsible for hardware updates. architecture diagram (private) 3. hybrid cloud a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. - examples: using azure arc to manage on-prem servers from the azure portal; keeping sensitive patient records on-prem (private) while running the patient portal web app on azure (public). - ownership: mix of microsoft (public) and yours (private). - cost: mixed capex (for private) and opex (for public). - pros: - flexibility: run workloads where they make the most sense. - compliance: keep sensitive data local. - backup: use public cloud for off-site backup/dr. - cons: - most complex to set up and manage. - requires robust networking (vpn, expressroute). 4. multi-cloud (bonus concept) using services from multiple public cloud providers (e.g., azure + aws + google cloud) simultaneously. - why?: avoid vendor lock-in, use best-of-breed features (e.g., google for ai, azure for enterprise basics). - management: azure arc allows you to manage resources across azure, aws, and gcp from a single pane of glass. --- 5. architecture diagram (hybrid cloud) --- --- 💡 hinglish explanation (deployment models) 1. public cloud (bus) - concept: shared infrastructure. - hinglish: jaise public bus hoti hai. seat aapki hai, par bus sabki hai. sasti padti hai aur maintenance driver (microsoft) karta hai. - who uses it?: startups, netflix, students. 2. private cloud (apni car) - concept: dedicated infrastructure. - hinglish: jaise khud ki car. poori car aapki hai, koi aur nahi aayega. security full hai, par petrol, servicing (maintenance) aur khareedne ka kharcha (capex) aapka hai. - who uses it?: banks, government (security ke liye). 3. hybrid cloud (taxi/rental) - concept: best of both worlds. - hinglish: roz office jaane ke liye apni car (private) use karo, par jab family trip pe jana ho toh badi bus (public) rent karlo. sensitive data ghar pe (private), baaki sab cloud pe (public). --- 🆚 summary comparison | feature | public cloud ☁️ | private cloud 🏢 | hybrid cloud 🔗 | | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------- | | hardware | shared (multi-tenant) | dedicated (single-tenant) | both | | cost model | opex (pay-as-you-go) | capex (upfront) | mixed | | maintenance | microsoft | you | mixed | | scalability | high | limited to your hardware | high (burst to public) | | security | standardized | highly customizable | custom + standard |"},{"title":"Ip Addresses","url":"00_ip_addresses.html","content":"🌍 ip addresses: types & versions (ipv4 vs ipv6) 📌 overview an ip (internet protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. it serves two main functions: 1. identification: \"who is this device?\" 2. addressing: \"where is this device located?\" think of it as your digital address or phone number on the internet. --- 🏷️ types of ip addresses 1. public vs private ip | feature | public ip 🌐 | private ip 🏠 | | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | | reachability | accessible from anywhere on the internet. | accessible only within the local network (lan/vnet). | | cost | usually paid (static) or assigned by isp. | free to use. | | uniqueness | must be unique globally. | must be unique only within the local network. | | example | `20.198.54.12` (azure region ip) | `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.5` | 2. static vs dynamic ip - dynamic ip: changes periodically (dhcp). most home routers and standard vms use this. - cloud context: when you stop/start a vm, its public ip might change. - static ip: fixed permanent address. - cloud context: used for dns servers, web servers requiring ssl, or firewall whitelisting. --- ⚔️ ipv4 vs ipv6 (the showdown) the internet ran out of ipv4 addresses, so ipv6 was created. 1. ipv4 (the legacy) - format: 32-bit numeric address. - notation: dotted decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). - total addresses: ~4.3 billion. - header: variable length (20-60 bytes). 2. ipv6 (the future) - format: 128-bit alphanumeric address. - notation: hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). - total addresses: 3.4 × 10^38 (undecillion) - virtually infinite. - header: fixed length (40 bytes) - simpler processing for routers. - security: ipsec is built-in (mandatory mainly). visual comparison diagram --- ☁️ cloud context (azure) in azure (and most clouds): - vnets primarily use private ipv4 (address space like `10.0.0.0/16`). - public ips are separate resources you attach to vms or load balancers. - ipv6 is supported mainly for dual-stack architectures (iot, mobile networks), but ipv4 is still the default standard for internal networking. --- 💡 hinglish explanation (mobile process) 1. ip address (phone number) - hinglish: ip address aapka phone number hai. agar aapko kisi se baat karni hai, toh number dial karna padega. 2. public vs private (personal vs intercom) - public ip: aapka personal mobile number. ispe koi bhi call kar sakta hai (internet). - private ip: society ka intercom number. sirf society ke log hi baat kar sakte hain. bahar se koi intercom par call nahi kar sakta. 3. ipv4 vs ipv6 (old vs new numbering) - ipv4 (10-digit number): pehle sabke paas 10 digit number the. lekin log itne badh gaye ki number khatam hone lage. - ipv6 (alpha-numeric id): ab sabko ek naya, lamba aur complex unique id mil raha hai jo kabhi khatam nahi hoga. isme letters bhi hain aur numbers bhi. --- ⚡ exam tips for az-900 1. private ips: remember the ranges `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`. azure vnets sit here. 2. public ip sku: in azure, public ips come in basic and standard skus. standard is secure by default (requires nsg to open). 3. ipv6: know that it solves the address exhaustion problem, but ipv4 is still king in vnet configuration."},{"title":"Ip Classes","url":"00_ip_classes.html","content":"🧮 ip addressing fundamentals: iana, classes & nid/hid 🌍 who controls ip addresses?

use case: high-performance, low-latency traffic distribution for non-http apps (e.g., sql alwayson, internal microservice calls). - features: - public: incoming internet traffic to vms. - internal: traffic between private ips inside a vnet. 🌐 azure application gateway (layer 7) operates at the application layer (http/https). it is a web traffic load balancer. - use case: web applications requiring ssl termination, cookie-based session affinity, or url path-based routing (`/images` goes to pool a, `/video` goes to pool b). - key feature: web application firewall (waf) - protects against common web attacks like sql injection & xss. --- 2. global load balancers (traffic across regions) 🌍 azure traffic manager dns-based traffic load balancer. it distributes traffic to services across global azure regions. - mechanism: use dns to direct client requests to the most appropriate endpoint based on a traffic-routing method (e.g., priority, weighted, geographic). - note: it does not see the traffic payload; it just returns the ip of the best regional endpoint. 🚪 azure front door a global, scalable entry-point that uses the microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications. -

round robin: - requests are assigned to servers in a strictly circular order (server a -> server b -> server c -> server a...). - best for: small applications where all servers have identical specs. - weighted round robin: - assigns more requests to powerful servers and fewer to weaker ones based on a weight (e.g., server a: 70%, server b: 30%). - best for: environments with mixed hardware capabilities. b. dynamic algorithms these do consider the real-time status of the server (cpu, ram, active connections). - least connection: sends request to the server with the fewest active connections. - resource based: checks cpu/memory usage before sending traffic. --- 4. high availability configurations 🛡️ active-active - concept: all load balancers/servers are active and processing traffic simultaneously. - benefit: utilization of all resources; higher throughput. - downside: if one fails, the others must handle the extra load immediately. active-passive (failover) -

no downtime: new vms are added while the application keeps running. - use case: web applications, microservices. vmss uses horizontal scaling. --- 2. orchestration modes 🎻 azure vmss provides two ways to manage the instances: 🅰️ uniform orchestration (review the \"classic\" vmss) this is the standard mode familiar to most users. - characteristics: uses identical vm instances (same image, same size) from a central configuration. - management: you manage the scale set, not individual vms. - pros: easy to scale to 1,000s of vms; faster provisioning; perfect for stateless stateless workloads. - cons: less flexibility if you need to tweak one specific vm. 🅱️ flexible orchestration (the new standard) brings the best of scale sets and availability sets together. - characteristics: treats vms like standard azure iaas vms but groups them for scaling. you can mix different vm types or spot instances. - management: you have full control over the individual nics and disks of the vms. - pros: high availability (spread across fault domains); easier troubleshooting; fast scaling. - recommendation: microsoft recommends flexible mode for most new workloads. --- 3. how vmss works 1. golden image: you provide a standard vm image (e.g., ubuntu web server with nginx installed) or a custom image (ami equivalent). 2. configuration: you set the \"instance count\" or \"autoscale rules\". 3. load balancer: a load balancer usually sits in front of the vmss to distribute traffic to all healthy instances. 🧠 autoscale rules you define when to add/remove vms. - metric-based: \"if average cpu > 75% for 5 minutes, add 1 vm.\" - time-based: \"every morning at 8 am, increase to 10 instances.\" 📐 architecture diagram --- 3. availability & fault tolerance vmss automatically distributes instances across: - fault domains (racks with separate power/network). - update domains (groups of vms that can be rebooted together for patching). - availability zones (different physical datacenters within a region). > note: an availability set is a similar concept but requires you to manage the vms individually. vmss manages them as a set. --- 4. 🛠️ hands-on: create vmss with azure cli step 1: create a resource group step 2: create a vm scale set this command creates a vmss with 2 instances, a load balancer, and generates ssh keys automatically. step 3: view the instances check the status of your running instances or list all resources in the group. step 4: manually scale out increase the instance count from default (2) to 5. step 5: configure autoscale (optional) add a rule to scale out when cpu > 70%. step 6: clean up don't forget to delete resources to avoid costs! --- 💡 exam tips for az-900 - scale sets = \"identical vms\" + \"autoscaling\". - vertical scaling = \"resize vm\" (downtime). - horizontal scaling = \"add more vms\" (no downtime). - elasticity = the property of vmss to scale automatically."},{"title":"Azure Virtual Desktop","url":"06_azure_virtual_desktop.html","content":"🖥️ azure virtual desktop (avd) 📌 overview azure virtual desktop (avd) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud. it allows users to access a full windows desktop or specific apps from any device (laptop, tablet, phone) securely. - formerly known as: windows virtual desktop (wvd). - core concept: your \"computer\" isn't on your desk; it's a vm in azure that is streamed to your screen. --- 1. why avd? (key benefits) 👥 windows 10/11 multi-session this is a unique feature available only in azure. - traditional vdi: 1 user = 1 vm. expensive. - avd multi-session: multiple users can log into the same windows 11 vm simultaneously. - benefit: drastically reduces cost (you pay for fewer vms). 🚀 optimized for microsoft 365 - office apps (outlook, teams, onedrive) often perform poorly in virtual environments due to caching issues. - avd is specifically optimized to make outlook/teams run as fast as a local pc. ☁️ paas management - microsoft manages: the gateway, web access, broker, and diagnostics (the complicated \"plumbing\"). - you manage: the desktop vms and policies. - comparison: much easier than setting up a traditional remote desktop services (rds) farm on-premise. --- 2. core components 🏨 host pools a collection of identical virtual machines that serve the desktops/apps to users. -

isolation: it is logically isolated from other networks in azure. - communication: allows resources to talk to each other securely. - filtering: you can filter traffic using network security groups (nsgs). - routing: you can control how traffic flows between subnets. --- 🏗️ architecture components 1. address space (cidr) when you create a vnet, you must specify a custom private ip address space using cidr notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`). 2. subnets a vnet can be segmented into smaller parts called subnets. this helps in organizing and securing resources. - example: `10.0.1.0/24` for web servers, `10.0.2.0/24` for database servers. - reserved ips: azure reserves the first 4 and the last 1 ip address in every subnet (total 5 ips reserved). architecture diagram (vnet structure) --- 🛡️ security (traffic filtering) 1. network security groups (nsg) an nsg contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of azure resources. - rules: based on source ip, destination ip, port, and protocol (5-tuple). - default: by default, all inbound traffic is blocked (except from vnet), and all outbound traffic is active. 2. application security groups (asg) asgs allow you to group vms based on their application logic (e.g., \"webservers\", \"dbservers\") rather than explicit ip addresses. this simplifies nsg rules. --- 🔗 connectivity (connecting vnets) 1. vnet peering connects two azure virtual networks. once peered, the vnets appear as one for connectivity purposes. - low latency: data flows over the ultra-fast microsoft backbone network. - non-transitive: if a connects to b, and b connects to c, a cannot talk to c automatically. you must explicitly peer a and c. architecture diagram (vnet peering) 3. step-by-step guide: creating vnet peering 🛠️ here is how you can practically implement peering between two vnets using azure cli. step 1: create two virtual networks (vnet1 & vnet2) step 2: initiate peering from vnet1 to vnet2 step 3: initiate peering from vnet2 to vnet1 peering must be reciprocal (both ways) to work. step 4: verify connectivity 4. vpn gateway used to send encrypted traffic between an azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet. --- 💡 hinglish explanation (housing society) 1. virtual network (housing society) -

(e.g., 2 subnets: web, db) 2. how many hosts (ips) per subnet? (e.g., 50 servers each) step 2: choose your network class/cidr start with a standard network block. - example: `192.168.1.0/24` (standard class c network). - total ips: 256. step 3: borrow bits (the calculation) to create 2 subnets, you need to borrow 1 bit (`2^1 = 2`). - original cidr: `/24` - new cidr: `/24` + `1 bit` = `/25` this splits the block perfectly in half. visual calculation example goal: split `192.168.1.0/24` into 2 subnets. 1. subnet a (first half) - range: `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.127` - cidr: `192.168.1.0/25` - total ips: 128 (usable: 123 in azure) 2. subnet b (second half) - range: `192.168.1.128` to `192.168.1.255` - cidr: `192.168.1.128/25` - total ips: 128 (usable: 123 in azure) > key rule: every time you increase the cidr number by 1 (e.g., /24 -> /25), you double the number of subnets but halve the number of ips in each. --- 🏗️ architecture: public vs private subnets although azure doesn't technically have \"public\" or \"private\" subnet types (like aws), we simulate them using nsgs and route tables. 1. public subnet - purpose: hosts resources that need to talk to the internet directly (e.g., web server, load balancer). - configuration: has a public ip address or is attached to a nat gateway/load balancer. - security: nsg allows inbound port 80/443. 2. private subnet - purpose: hosts backend resources (e.g., database, internal app) that should never be exposed to the internet. - configuration: no public ip. outbound access only via firewall/nat. - security: nsg denies all inbound internet traffic. architecture diagram (segmentation) --- 🎓 advanced concepts 1. subnet delegation some azure services (like azure container instances, app service vnet integration) require a subnet to be \"delegated\" (dedicated) to them. - once delegated, you cannot put other resources (like normal vms) in that subnet. 2. service endpoints allows you to extend your vnet identity to azure services (like storage or sql). - traffic flows from your vnet -> azure backbone -> storage account (without going over public internet). 3. private endpoints (private link) brings the azure service (like sql db) inside your vnet with a private ip. this is the most secure method. --- 💡 hinglish explanation (office layout) 1. subnet (departments) - hinglish: poori building (vnet) mein alag-alag floors hain. - floor 1 (reception/public): yahan bahar ke log aa sakte hain (public subnet). - floor 2 (finance/private): yahan sirf staff aa sakta hai, bahar wale allowed nahi (private subnet). 2. 5 reserved ips (staff area) - hinglish: har floor pe 5 cabin management ke liye reserved hain (manager, electrician, guard, etc.). inhe aap use nahi kar sakte. 3. service endpoint (direct tunnel) - hinglish: finance team ko bank jana hai. sadak (internet) se jaane ke bajaye, unhone ek underground tunnel (service endpoint) bana li jo seedha bank nikalti hai. safe aur fast. --- ⚡ exam tips for az-900 1. calculation: if a question asks \"how many usable ips in a /24 subnet?\", the answer is 251 (256 - 5 reserved). 2. delegation: certain paas services require a dedicated (empty) subnet. 3. security: you secure subnets using network security groups (nsgs), not by just naming them \"private\"."}]
